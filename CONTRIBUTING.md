## contributing to trousseau
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's for:

- reporting a bug
- discussing the current state of the code
- submitting a fix
- proposing new features
- becoming a maintainer

## we develop with github
We use github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. if you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. if you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. use a consistent coding style
5. ensure the test suite passes.
6. make sure your code lints.
7. issue that pull request :)

## any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0.
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/Trousseau-io/trousseau/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## report bugs using github's [issues](https://github.com/Trousseau-io/trousseau/issues)
We use github issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it is the way!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Use one of the existing templates or follow some example like [this is one](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) or [another one](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- a quick summary and/or background
- precise steps to reproduce (spending a few extra minutes to document might same hours of ping-pong)
- what you expected would happen
- what actually happens
- any hint towards a possible root cause and fix
