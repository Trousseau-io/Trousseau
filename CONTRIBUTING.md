# Contributing Guide

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project and make it as easy and transparent as possible! If you aren't sure what to expect, here are some guidelines for our project so you feel more comfortable with how things will go.

If this is your first contribution to Trousseau, we encourage you to walk through this guideline helping you to setup your dev environment, make a change, test it and open a pull request about it. 

## Code of Conduct
The Trousseau community is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This includes but isn't limited to: Trousseau GitHub repositories, Discussions, interaction on social media, conferences and meetups. 

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions includings:

* [Documentation](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/wiki)
* Social Media, blog post, webinar

* Build, CI/CD, QA help, release management
* [Review Pull Request](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/pulls)
* Web, logo, diagrams design

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Do not hesitate to start a [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/discussions) about any of the above topics or anything other relevant to the project. 

## Find an Issue
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. As a start, we have labelled [good first issues](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for new contributors and [help wanted](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues suitable for any contributor who isn't a core maintainer. 

Sometimes there won't be any issues with these labels. That's ok! There is likely something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you don't know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out via the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/discussions) for guidance. 

Once you see an issue that you would like to work on, please post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something as simple as "I want to work/help on this" is fine :)

## Ask for Help
The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/discussions). 

## Which branch to use 
For any issues, your branch should be against the ***release/latest*** branch except if explicit guidance within the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/issues) description. 

## When to open a pull request
For none related code changes like like documentation improvement, misspellings and such, you can submit a PR directly including a clear descriptions. 

For any code changes, all pull request have to be linked with a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/issues). If not, please make an issue first, explain the problem or motivation for the code change you are proposing. When the solution isn't solution is not straightforward, make sure to outline the expected outcome with examples. Your PR will go smoother if the solution is agreed upon via the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ondat/trousseau/issues) before you have spent a lot of time implementing it.
